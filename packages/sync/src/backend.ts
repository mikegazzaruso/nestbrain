 * Pluggable remote sync backend — the open-core seam.

 * "Team Server" adapter — provides the actual transport. This keeps the
 * *interface* open (anyone can target a backend) while the Enterprise server,
 * its HTTP client, end-to-end encryption and licensing stay proprietary.
 *
 * Model (vs. the Drive adapter's file-id + changes feed): a workspace is a
 * versioned **manifest** (path → content hash) plus a set of content-addressed
 * **blobs**. Commits use optimistic concurrency; conflicts are reconciled
 * client-side with the union / keep-both rules below.
